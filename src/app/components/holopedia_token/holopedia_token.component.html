  <h2>Holopedia Tokens Hybrid ~ Introduction</h2>
  <div class="intro">
    Holopedia Tokens Hybrid has been created to serve as a payment method for holographic content that is shared among Holopedia
    platform users. Holopedia will incentivize users to upload holographic data of different kind by rewarding them
    Holopedia Tokens.<br><br>

    Holopedia Tokens Hybrid is currently developeing holograms oriented DApps (HoloApps) that will facilitate gamification of
    the activities around hologram content browsing, sharing and use in specialized display devices. <br>
    With HoloApps the users will be able to interact with the network and easily obtain Holopedia Tokens
    from activity on the site.

    <h4>Funds</h4>
    Funds generated withing Holopedia Project will be invested in access to medical body scanning equipment
    such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI, Computer Tomography CT scan to gather data to build health related holograms, and in later stage work towards
    personalized, hologram assisted therapies available for Holopedia Network users, therapists, doctors. <br><br>

    [Architecture Holopedia] Quantum states are characterized such that they cannot be directly observed without the
    change of those states throught the act of observation. Other means need to be developed to be able to make use from
    given quantum states. A proposed way is through holography and holographic tools. Melanie Swan (Swan, June 2020 [1])
    describes such technology where quantum computing is an Internet cloud environment with holographic control theory
    used as macroscale controller.<br><br>

    [DLT HP] Holopedia Project closely observes and follows the preparations for Quantum Blockchain (Swan, 2020 [2])
    emergence which in the next phase
    will the network of choice that better suits the Holopedia Project's vision to manufacture and operate holograms a
    means to interface with
    quantum physics realm.<br><br>

    [Holarchies] Holarchy, a holon based type of hierarchy, is characterized such that every of its levels is
    the whole at different resolution. Many recents theories describe human consciousness as a holonic element
    of universe~wide holarchy and as such distributed in every part of the cosmosphere, a quantum-holographic brain-mind
    [3]<br><br>

    [organizations] An organizational pattern of the system can be called holographic when its inner orderliness is
    governed by multilevel, multidirectional,
    and complex holistic information network system formed by internal feedback loops that follows holoinformational and
    self-organizing theory [4].<br><br>

  <h2>Holopedia Tokens Hybrid ~ Technical procedures</h2>

  <h4>Holopedia Ecosystem</h4>
  <p>
    Holopedia ecosystem is built with tokens & coins developed on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Holopedia
    Tokens
    are smart contracts
    within Ethereum network (ERC20) and Holopedia Coins are so called alt coins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both tokens and coins are deployed within DLT network and they are synchronized across the entire network. The
    synchronisation is handled by the Client Synchronization Protocol which is a secure mechanism the role of which is
    to update the server gets whenever any new transaction is made within the network. All new transactions within the
    network are automatically synchronized with clients that are connected to the network. The clients is ready to
    indroduce new transactions when first it is synchronized with the network.
  </p>

  <h4>Tokens & Coins distribution & exchanges structure</h4>

  <p>
    Holopedia Tokens Hybrid is developed as ERC20 smart contract and thus benefits from simple adoption. 
    You can use your favorite Ethereum wallet and add the token either by the token name, or using a contract key that you can find on
    <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x790b3425e48fdEfA9fd9234462E4634594B23835">Etherscan</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>Internal payment</h4>
  <p>
    Holopedia Tokens Hybrid has been created to serve as a payment method for holographic & 3D content that is shared
    among platform users. Holopedia project facilitates user based content and will rewarding them Holopedia Tokens &
    Coins for various activites on the network including signing up, refererring other users and uploading
    holographic & 3D contect.
  </p>

  <h4>Holopedia Tokens Hybrid Distributed Ledger Technology DLT</h4>
  <p>
    Distributed Ledger Technology is a decentrilized network that does not consist of one point of failure.
    Data is distributed and syncronized across the nodes where each node contain the cope of the entire ledger.
    This has several advantages over centralized network. It is not dependant on a central authority, both in terms
    of decision making and for the data safety. The security of the transactions within the network is validated by
    the whole network through its concensus algorithm.

  <p>
    A proposal to introduce internal fees and settlements in the Holopedia network using Coins based on Distributed
    Ledger
    Technologies (DLT). Within that, we offer server support with supermicro servers with the possibility of server
    cluster expansion and DLT service support.
