  <h2>Holopedia Token ~ Introduction</h2>
  <div class="intro">
    Holopedia Token has been created to serve as a payment method for holographic content that is shared among Holopedia
    platform users. Holopedia will incentivize users to upload holographic data of different kind by rewarding them
    Holopedia Tokens.<br><br>

    Holopedia Token is an ERC20 token and thus benefits from simple adaptivity, you just need to add the token to your 
    favourite Ethereum wallet (search by token name or by contract key from 
    <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x790b3425e48fdEfA9fd9234462E4634594B23835" target="_blanks">Etherscan</a>).<br><br>
    
    Holopedia Token is currently developeing holograms oriented DApps (HoloApps) that will facilitate gamification of the 
    activities around hologram content browsing, sharing and use in specialized display devices. <br>
    With HoloApps the users will be able to interact with the network and easily obtain Holopedia Tokens
    from activity on the site. 
    
    <h4>Funds</h4>
    Funds generated withing Holopedia Project will be invested in access to medical body scanning equipment 
    such as MRI, CT scan to gather data to build health related holograms, and in later stage work towards 
    personalized, hologram assisted therapies available for Holopedia Network users, therapists, doctors. <br><br>

    [Architecture Holopedia] Quantum states are characterized such that they cannot be directly observed without the change of those states
    throught the act of observation. Other means need to be developed to be able to make use from given quantum states.
    A proposed way is through holography and holographic tools. Melanie Swan (Swan, June 2020 [1]) describes such
    technology where quantum computing is an Internet cloud environment with holographic control theory used as macroscale controller.<br><br>

    [DLT HP] Holopedia Project closely observes and follows the preparations for Quantum Blockchain (Swan, 2020 [2]) emergence which in the next phase
    will the network of choice that better suits the Holopedia Project's vision to manufacture and operate holograms a means to interface with 
    quantum physics realm.<br><br>

    [Holarchies] Holarchy, a holon based type of hierarchy, is characterized such that every of its levels is 
    the whole at different resolution. Many recents theories describe human consciousness as a holonic element
    of universe~wide holarchy and as such distributed in every part of the cosmosphere, a quantum-holographic brain-mind [3]<br><br>

    [organizations] An organizational pattern of the system can be called holographic when its inner orderliness is governed by multilevel, multidirectional, 
    and complex holistic information network system formed by internal feedback loops that follows holoinformational and self-organizing theory [4].<br><br>
